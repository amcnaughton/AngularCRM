AngularJS CRM viewer
====================

A local non-profit needed to surface data from their CRM system inside a content management system. 

I built an AngularJS (1.X) frontend for browsing and editing client records. The Angular app calls a custom RESTful API that I implemented in PHP. This API provides a more suitable level of abstraction that the CRM system's existing API.

The code in this repository is for reference only. It does not include all the necessary pieces to recreate the entire execution environment.

Search Capabilities
-------------------
The app supports complex multi-attribute searches (including by geocode) and provides mechanisms to filter  result sets.

Video Walkthrough
